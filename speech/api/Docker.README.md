# Run the Speech sample using Docker

## Service Account
Add a service account JSON file in this directory named `service-account.json`.
The `service-account.json` will be copied into the image generated by the
`Dockerfile`.

## Install Docker
Installing Docker is outside of scope for this README. Review the Docker
[documentation][1] to get started.

## Build
Build the Docker image using the following command. You can change the name by
of the image by modifying `cpp-speech`.

```bash
  docker build -t cpp-speech .
```

## Run Samples
Run the Docker image using the following command.
_Note this will vary depending on the image name used._

```bash
  docker run -it cpp-speech bash
  cd /home/cpp-docs-samples/speech/api/
  make run_tests
```
