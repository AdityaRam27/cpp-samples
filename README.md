# C++ Docs Samples

A small collection of samples that demonstrate how to call
Google Cloud services from C++.

The samples in this repo cover only a _small fraction_ of the total APIs that you can call from C++.
See the [googleapis repo](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis) to see the full list of APIs callable from C++.

These samples will only build and run on Unix.
